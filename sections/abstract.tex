This report presents the design, implementation, and testing of an electronics system developed as part of an Electronics Design Project at \CampusName. The sample project used in this template is a \SI{12}{\volt} to \SI{5}{\volt} synchronous buck converter intended for embedded systems.

The report covers requirements definition, circuit selection, component calculations, PCB considerations, firmware (if applicable), verification tests, and measured results. The template is structured to support typical electronics deliverables including a block diagram, schematic references, bill of materials (BOM), test plan, and compliance considerations.
