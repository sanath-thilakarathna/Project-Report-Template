\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
This project demonstrated an end-to-end electronics design workflow: requirements definition, circuit design, PCB implementation, and verification against measurable acceptance criteria.

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend the input range and add surge protection.
  \item Improve thermal performance using copper pours and additional vias.
  \item Add output telemetry and fault logging.
\end{itemize}
