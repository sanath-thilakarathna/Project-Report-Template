\chapter{Implementation}

\section{Schematic Capture}
Provide a short description of the schematic organization (power stage, feedback network, protection, connectors). Include figure exports as needed.

\section{PCB Layout}
Include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Layer stack-up (2-layer example)
  \item Critical nets and current paths
  \item Design rule checks (DRC)
\end{itemize}

\section{Prototype Assembly}
Document the assembly process, tools used, and any rework performed.

\section{Firmware (If Applicable)}
If the design includes firmware (e.g., telemetry, fault logging), describe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Architecture and modules
  \item Interfaces (I\textsuperscript{2}C, SPI, UART)
  \item Key parameters and calibration
\end{itemize}
