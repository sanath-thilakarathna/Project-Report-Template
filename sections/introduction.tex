\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
Electronics design projects commonly require translating a set of system-level constraints (input supply range, output regulation, efficiency, thermal limits, cost, and manufacturability) into an implementable circuit and testable prototype. Standard circuit design references and vendor application notes are commonly used to justify design choices and calculations \cite{sedra_smith_microelectronic_2014,ti_buck_design}.

\section{Project Overview}
This template assumes an example power electronics subsystem: a regulated \SI{5}{\volt} rail derived from a \SI{12}{\volt} source for a microcontroller-based embedded system.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Define measurable electrical and mechanical requirements.
  \item Design and simulate the circuit (where applicable).
  \item Implement the design on a PCB and assemble a prototype.
  \item Verify performance using a documented test plan.
\end{itemize}

\section{Report Structure}
Chapter 2 defines requirements, Chapters 3--4 describe design and implementation, Chapters 5--6 present verification and results, and the final chapter summarizes conclusions and future work.
